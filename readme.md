# TicTacToe

As an unemployed programmer I figured I would freshen up on my C++ skills by creating TicTacToe!

## (I know, how original)

But as an added bonus I made it a game of minigames, including TicTacToe and soon maybe FourInARow.

### Yay

"Install" it by building it

```shell
cd path/to/project
g++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
```

Run with
```shell
./tictactoe
```
